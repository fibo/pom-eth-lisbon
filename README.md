## The problem

In an era plagued with bots and countless other bad actors, it is extremely difficult to verify the validity of human interactions. Countless innocent people have had their lives ruined by false allegations from people claiming to have known them personally. When this happens, the truth is that some people will think one way, and others will arm themselves with other assumptions, sometimes creating a deadly case of misinformation.

If a person follows back, messages, or connects with another person, it is generally assumed that both individuals know each other. However, if this is not true, how must we verify the status of a meaningful interaction?

Just as a nation is sovereign, meaning that nothing can take away its right to exist, ordinary individuals deserve the right to own all of their personal information and relationships. It is imperative that no entity or person should control another person’s data. After all, web3 is all about ownership.

## The Solution

*Proof Of Meet* (**POM**) allows people to verify the existence of their ordinary human interactions. If Person A meets Person B for the first time, one user will create a POM, and both users will confirm the initial transaction generating an on-chain memory lasting forever, thereby proving that both persons have in fact met each other.

Users will have the option to upload a picture of their “meet”, log a location, and either make a POM private or publicly visible. By creating a POM, individuals will be able to truly own their data, moving one step further to achieving the system-wide imposition of self-sovereign identities (SSI).
